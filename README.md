# olcPGEX_Media
Video player for the Pixel Game Engine (http://onelonecoder.com/)

Already functional, but work in progress (requires API polishing, documentation, as well as harmful and "exotic" video format handling).

TODO:
- Figure out if required files can be uploaded due license (such as static/dynamic libraries, fffmpeg headers so the user won't have to compile ffmpeg himself).
- Test out library with other OS and compilers (currently library has only been tested with Windows10 + MSVC).
